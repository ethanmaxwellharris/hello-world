     <h2><strong>
       Reflection on 30 minutes of reading, "Ten arguments for deleting your social media accounts right now"
</strong> </h2>
	<p>
		Jaron Lanier's book, "Ten arguments for deleting your social media accounts right now" opens by engaging the reader with cats, a trope that pervades the Internet to no end. In fact, if you follow the CSS lessons on freecodecamp.com you'll find a pleasant kitten'y surprise for you there. 
		Lanier, who is a Silicon Valleite himself, urges the reader to consider the consequences of engagement and the social media monster that has ravaged through the ego the past decade.
		He starts his quest by educating the reader about the behavior modification techniques, and what they are, which seek to keep you addicted to the activity you're focused on.
		I couldn't help but think about the game, Harry Potter Puzzles & Spells since I've been somewhat "engaged" with it over the past few weeks. I've always taken the "high road" and avoided such trivial and "brain dead" games of it's ilk such as Candy Crush.
		But darnit, they try so hard to suck me in. Between the shiny bits, the explosive ending when you successfully finish a puzzle, points flying around the screen to their respective places and the overlay of nostalgia inducing thematics from the Harry Potter world I find it hard to avoid. Oh! A notification just let me know that a new event has started. 
		So when Lanier points out that I've been B.F. Skinner'd into playing this game repeatedly I can't help but feel a sense of nihilistic dread as I wonder about what other algorithmic-induced horrors are lurking in my subconscious waiting to influence me at a time of weakness.
		I refuse to buy gold coins to replenish my hearts and keep playing Zynga, please stop.
		I bet you can think of some other platform that has behaviorally modified your commodity of a brain into using it constantly. Instagram gives you hearts, Facebook grants you likes, and Reddit gives you a platform to feel smug as you downvote those who disagree with your poorly formed opinion.
		No matter the platform, you're being tracked, monitored, and subjugated to stress and feedback for the purpose of "growth" on their end and "engagement" on yours.
		We all should know this by now, I'm interested to see how Lanier proposes we "fight back" per se.
		It's been some time since I've actively participated in social media, with the exception of Reddit which is simply an "anti-social-media social media", but I look forward to the remainder of my reads.

	<h2>Some Quotes On Sugar Water</h2>

	<ul>
			 <li><p>“Do you want to sell sugar water for the rest of your life, or do you want to come with me and change the world?” What Steve Jobs said to Pepsi executive John Sculley to lure him to Apple. Sculley mentions it in the documentary Bloomberg Game Changers</p></li>

			 <li><b>Kay</b>: I don't suppose you know what kind of alien life form leaves a green spectral trail and craves sugar water, do you?</li>
			 <p><b>Jay</b>: Aw that was on Final Jeopardy last night. Come on what did Alex say?</p>

			 <p><b>Kay</b>: Zed, we got a bug.</p></li>
